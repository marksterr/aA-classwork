# Rails One Practice

You will have **100 minutes** to complete this evaluation. This evaluation consists
of 4 components:

1. [SQL](./sql/README.md)
2. [ActiveRecord Querying](./active_record_queries/README.md)
3. [Migrations](./migrations/README.md)
4. [Associations](./associations/README.md)

## Scoring and time estimates

| Component                | Maximum Points  | Estimated Time (minutes) |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| SQL                      | 10 (2 per spec) | 20 min                   |
| ActiveRecord Querying    | 10              | 25 min                   |
| Migrations               | 18              | 15 min                   |
| Associations             | 25              | 30 min                   |

The maximum number of points for this entire
evaluation is **63**. Your final score will be calculated as the percentage of
points awarded over the maximum number of points:

`score = (total_points_awarded / 63) * 100`

The passing score for this evaluation is **80**.

## Submission

- Rename the directory `"#{first_name}_#{last_name}"`.
- **Remove any `tmp` and `vendor`** folders to ensure your file won't be too
  big.
- ZIP it (you can use OS X's built in zip functionality)
- Make sure you submit a `.zip`; no boutique formats please :-)

Good luck!
